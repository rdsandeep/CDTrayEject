CDTrayEject

This is a module for the Mayhem application(http://mayhem.codeplex.com)
It contains just one reaction that pops open the CD Tray.
(It could be used in the phone remote event like, when a button on the phone is pressed, the tray is ejected)

To use this, copy the contents of bin\Debug folder into
C:\Program Files (x86)\Outercurve\Mayhem
Then launch Mayhem and you are done.
